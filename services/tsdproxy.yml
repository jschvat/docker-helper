# This service does not expose any ports to the host network.
# It runs in the background and exposes other containers to your Tailscale network.
# You need to add labels to the containers you want to expose.
# Example labels for another container:
#   - "tsdproxy.enable=true"
#   - "tsdproxy.name=my-service"
